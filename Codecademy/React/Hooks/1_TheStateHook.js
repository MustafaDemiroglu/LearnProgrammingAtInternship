/*
    React offers a number of built-in Hooks. A few of these include useState(), useEffect(), useContext(), useReducer(), and useRef(). See the full list in the React docs.

    In this lesson, we’ll learn how to:

    Build a “stateful” function component.
    Use the State Hook.
    Initialize a state and set a state.
    Define event handlers.
    Use state setter callback functions.
    Use state with arrays and objects.
